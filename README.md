# hello-world
My name is Samuel Torres, I am somewhat new to programming but I enjoy it very much.
My main focus areas are JavaScript, jQuery + AJAX/XML/JSON.
I am still learning and am going to learn SQL and PHP soon.
I hope to interact with programmers on here from all over the world. I am also excited to learn from others as I know there are some very experiences programmers out there.
