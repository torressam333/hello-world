# hello-world
My name is Samuel Torres, I have been programming for a few years now but profesionally for 1 :P.
My main focus areas are JavaScript and PHP. Lately I have been very into learning React and Laravel and hope to also dive into Node a bit more. AWS is another area of focus for me as I have been preparing for my CDA Exam. I hope to acquire this Cert. in 2020.

For now, off to code some more.
